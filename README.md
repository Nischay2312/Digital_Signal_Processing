# Digital_Signal_Processing
DSP using ESP32

Real-time digital signal processing by implementing a Low Pass IIR filter on a microcontroller (ESP 32). Used an Inertial Measurement Unit (MPU6050) as the source of signal to be filtered. 

Utilized MATLAB to help design the filter by examining the harmonic content of the signal and testing out filters with different cutoff frequencies. The final filter was implemented on the microcontroller system that works real-time.
